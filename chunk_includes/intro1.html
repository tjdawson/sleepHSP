    <p>
        <h2>There are two parts to this study, one conducted here and the other to be completed at home over the internet.</h2>
    <ul><h3>Part 1: At the end of each video, your job is to make guesses about the meanings of the mystery word in the video.</h3>
    <li>You must make at least one guess, but you will be able to provide up to 5 guesses for each video.</li>
    <li>For each guess, please use just a single word, such as "unicorn", rather than either/or responses ("unicorn/find") or phrases or sentences (e.g., "Find the unicorn!").</li>
    <li>The same mystery word may occur in one or more videos, so you may make the same guesses for one or more videos that you watch.</li>
    <li style="font-weight: bold">For each guess you make, we want you to rate how confident you are.</li>
    <li>You will use a scale where a rating of 1 means you are <b>not at all confident</b> in your guess and a rating of 5 means that you are <b>very confident</b>.
    <ul><li style="font-style: italic">Please feel free to use the full range of the scale when reporting your confidence.</li></ul></li>

    <li>When you are finished making your guesses for a video, please look up at the television.</li>
    <li>The experimenter will wait until everybody is ready before proceeding to the next video.</li>
    <li>Please do not begin guessing before a video has ended.</li>
    <li>You will be watching 60 videos altogether, which will take about 1 hour.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
