    <p>
        When you came into the lab either yesterday evening, or earlier this morning for Part 1 of the experiment, you watched videos of parents interacting with their kids.
        During these videos, 12 novel words were uttered (if you recall the rest of the audio was silenced), and you were exposed to each of these 12 words 5 times.
        Now we want to ask you the meanings of those words.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be listening to audio files of the mystery words you heard in the videos. Each file will play the mystery word twice.
        Then, you will be asked a question about the meaning of that word. For example, "Does blick mean unicorn?"  You will respond by clicking 'yes' or 'no' below the audio file player.
        Then, you will rate from 1 to 5 how confident you were in your answer. A rating of 1 means you are not at all sure of your guess and a rating of 5 means you are very sure.
        This will be the same procedure for every word.
